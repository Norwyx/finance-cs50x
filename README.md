# Finance

A web application that stores user sessions and allows them to register, login and logout.

It retrieves information from the Yahoo's API and displays updated information in real time.

Each user of the application can:
- Quote stocks. That is, looking up for a stock symbol and getting its real time price.
- Buy stocks. Look for a stock symbol and selecting the amount of shares they intend to buy.
- Sell stocks. When a user buys an stock it saves in their database. They can then sell whatever stock they own and get cash back.
- See their history. See every transactions they executed in the past with the stock price at that time, and the exact date and time they transacted.
